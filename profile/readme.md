<h1 align="left">Swarmâ€™s Presentation</h3>

ðŸ”¶ As the Cardano community expands, due to the largest project to fund proposals today (the Catalyst Project), it became urgent to have a ***group of experienced people in this universe***. Therefore, we, together, ***work towards the development of several parallel projects that concern the maintenance and evolution of the community***.

ðŸ”· Our work is very wide and is made up of several people, of different nationalities, origins and social contexts. In other words, it is a very ***heterogeneous and versatile team***, since each one has a performance that is more harmonious with what they have skills and, above all, interests.

ðŸ”¶ Swarm's philosophy is different. The important thing for Swarm, is to promote change, through the work of autonomous and truly engaged individuals. You can better understand the inner workings of the group in [this](https://github.com/Catalyst-Swarm/.github/blob/2c0a9bad775d47f06975a1f11fc63a117bad0a5e/README.md).
